Features Implemented:
    1) keys 1, 2, 3, 4 set the heightfield to POINT, WIREFRAME, TRIANGLE, and SMOOTHING modes respectively. 
    2) keys 9 and 0 increase/decrease (respectively) the exponent factor (in smoothing mode)
    3) keys - and + increase/decrease (respectively) the scale (in smoothing mode)
    4) holding shift and dragging changes the y-axis scale
    5) holding tab and dragging translates the camera
    6) Animation is in the root of the assignment, titled animation_complete.mp4
    7) EBOs and DrawElementArray were used for the wireframe and triangle mode. EBO.h and EBO.cpp added in OpenGLHelper
    8) when pressing key 'r', changes the shader to a custom fragment shader, that makes the heightfield cycle through the colors of a rainbow.
    9) pressing keys 5, 6, and/or 7 will apply a texture map onto the heightfield.
